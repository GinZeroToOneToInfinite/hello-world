# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, the new world just opened up for me! I am a green hand here in the world of programming and algorithms. Challenging as it is, I am recently trying to get exhilarated by all new things I want to learn! I have been trying to stick to a particular project that I found boring and hard, which proves to be wrong. Will I stick to those things only if I succeed in finding joy and motivation in all of them. All in all, try to exploit your latent potential by stimulating your powerful nature. Believe me, the brain will never obey to you only if there is abundant joy.
